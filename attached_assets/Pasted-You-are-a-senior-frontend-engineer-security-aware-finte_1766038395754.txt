You are a senior frontend engineer + security-aware fintech UI reviewer.

Context:
This is the “Deposit Funds” modal for Finatrades (Card payment).
The UI already exists. DO NOT redesign or change the flow.
Your task is to REVIEW, ALIGN, and HARDEN the modal based on existing platform rules.

REFERENCE:
Deposit Funds modal with:
- Order Summary (Amount, Method, Total)
- Card Details iframe/fields
- SSL indicator
- Pay CTA
- Cancel CTA

OBJECTIVES (must follow in order):

1) UI CONSISTENCY CHECK (VERY IMPORTANT)
- Match this modal’s:
  - background color
  - border radius
  - shadow
  - typography
  - button style
  - spacing
with the EXISTING user dashboard + sidebar theme.
DO NOT introduce new colors or fonts.
Extract tokens from dashboard and reuse them.

Ensure:
- Modal background matches dashboard surface color
- Order Summary card matches other cards in dashboard
- Primary button style matches dashboard primary CTA
- Cancel button matches secondary/outline buttons used elsewhere

2) SECURITY UI VERIFICATION (NO LOGIC CHANGE)
Confirm and enforce:
- Card inputs are rendered ONLY via:
  - PCI-compliant iframe OR provider SDK element
- No card number, expiry, CVV:
  - stored in state
  - logged
  - sent to backend
- Lock icon + “256-bit SSL Encrypted” text is purely informational (UI only)

Add safeguards:
- Disable browser autocomplete for card fields if custom inputs exist
- Ensure modal does NOT expose any provider keys in frontend JS

3) DATA BINDING CHECK
Verify that:
- Amount shown in Order Summary comes from the SAME source as:
  - gold equivalent calculation
  - backend validation
- No hardcoded values like "$100" exist in UI
- CTA text “Pay $XXX” dynamically reflects validated amount

If mismatch is detected:
- Fix by using a single derived value (validatedAmountUsd)

4) VALIDATION & UX SAFETY
Before allowing “Pay”:
- Amount must already be validated (min/max)
- If validation fails:
  - Show inline message
  - Disable Pay button
  - Do NOT open card entry

Ensure:
- Loading state on Pay button
- Button is disabled during payment processing
- Prevent double submit

5) ACCESSIBILITY & TRUST SIGNALS
Ensure:
- Modal traps focus
- Escape key closes modal
- Buttons have aria-labels
- Card section has clear security copy but no misleading claims

6) ERROR HANDLING (UI ONLY)
If payment fails:
- Show clean error message (no provider raw error)
- Do NOT expose:
  - error codes
  - gateway IDs
  - internal references
- Provide retry + cancel options

7) ADMIN / LOGGING (NO SENSITIVE DATA)
Ensure frontend logs:
- action started
- action completed / failed
- requestId only

Never log:
- card number
- expiry
- CVV
- provider token

8) FINAL CHECKLIST (must confirm)
- Modal UI matches dashboard theme
- No hardcoded amounts
- No card data leakage
- Single source of truth for amount
- Pay button safe & idempotent
- Cancel always exits cleanly

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- List of issues found (if any)
- Exact file paths to fix
- Confirmation checklist (PASS/FAIL per item)
- NO redesign suggestions beyond consistency & safety

Do NOT change business logic.
Do NOT change payment flow.
Do NOT introduce new dependencies.
