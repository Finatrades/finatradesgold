# 🟡 **BASE44 PROMPT — SNAKE STYLE ANIMATION (PERSONAL VERSION)**

### **How It Works – Personal User Journey**

```
Create a fully animated “How It Works” section in a flowing snake-style journey for the Finatrades Personal Platform.

Overall Concept:
A smooth golden snake-shaped timeline that moves horizontally and flows upward/downward in curves, stopping at each step with a glowing highlight. The animation should feel premium, Swiss-grade, and fintech-clean.

Style Requirements:
• Black background with soft golden gradients
• Thin neon lines forming a snake path
• Floating particles and soft moving dots along the path
• Each step node will light up when reached
• Smooth flowing transitions from one step to the next
• Transparent cards for text with gold-glow borders
• Premium, minimal, luxury look (UBS × Apple × Emirates)

Animation Behavior:
The snake path draws itself in real-time, moving the viewer step-by-step. Each node expands with a subtle pulse animation when the snake reaches it.

Steps for PERSONAL:

Step 01 — Create Your Account
Icon: Minimal user icon with golden outline
Text: “Register as an Individual and start your personal gold account.”

Step 02 — Verify Your Identity
Icon: Shield or ID card
Text: “Complete Swiss-aligned KYC verification securely.”

Step 03 — Deposit or Buy Gold
Icon: Gold bar
Text: “Deposit physical gold via partners or buy new gold on-platform (where available).”

Step 04 — Secure Vault Storage
Icon: Vault door
Text: “Your gold is stored in approved, regulated vaults with full documentation.”

Step 05 — Track Your Gold 24/7
Icon: Dashboard/graph
Text: “See grams, estimated value, and certificates in real time.”

Step 06 — Optional: Join Holding Plans (BNSL)
Icon: Clock/Timer
Text: “Lock gold into structured holding plans for defined durations.”

Motion Sequence:
• Snake line animates → Step lights up → Text card fades in → Icon glows → Moves to next step.
• End with a final golden glow and CTA “Explore Personal Platform”.

Make it elegant, premium, and highly polished.
```

### **How It Works – Business User Journey**

```
Create a fully animated “How It Works” section in a structured snake-style path for the Finatrades Business Platform.

Overall Concept:
A metallic gold snake timeline representing a corporate workflow. Use a more structured, institutional style—sharper corners, precise geometry, and enterprise-level animations. The snake should look like a controlled digital flow that moves between corporate checkpoints.

Style Requirements:
• Deep black background with metallic gold accents
• Precision-line snake path with smooth turns
• Subtle digital particles moving along the path
• Corporate-style node indicators with LED-like lights
• Transparent rectangular text cards with gold edge strokes
• Serious, institutional, compliant feel (BlackRock × Goldman Sachs × Swiss Banking)

Animation Behavior:
The snake line illuminates each corporate step, giving a sense of governance, compliance, and operational control.

Steps for BUSINESS:

Step 01 — Register a Corporate Profile
Icon: Building or corporate outline
Text: “Submit company details, authorized signatories, and compliance documents.”

Text: “Finatrades performs a Swiss-aligned corporate verification process.”

Step 03 — Establish Gold Reserve Account
Icon: Multi-user or dashboard with roles
Text: “Set user roles, permissions, and operational limits for your organization.”

Step 04 — Deposit Physical Gold
Icon: Gold bars + warehouse
Text: “Deposit existing bars through verified channels into approved vaults.”

Step 05 — Receive Vault Certificates
Icon: Certificate or stamp
Text: “Each deposit generates standardized vault documentation.”

Step 06 — Use Gold Value for Trade & Treasury
Icon: Arrows or global trade icon
Text: “Integrate gold value into trade flows, settlements, or collateral structures.”

Step 07 — Reporting & Audit Controls
Icon: File or graph
Text: “Access detailed reports for accounting, governance, and external audits.”

Motion Sequence:
• Corporate snake animates in a controlled rhythm.
• At each node: glow pulse → icon highlight → text card slides up.
• End with CTA: “Explore Business Platform”.

Make it serious, powerful, regulated, and enterprise-grade.
