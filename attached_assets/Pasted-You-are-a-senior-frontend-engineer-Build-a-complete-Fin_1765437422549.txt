You are a senior frontend engineer.
Build a complete **FinaPay Wallet** module UI for the Finatrades platform.

This is a DIGITAL GOLD WALLET where users:
- See their gold balance and fiat equivalent
- View recent transactions
- Buy gold
- Sell gold (cash-out)
- Send gold to other users
- Request gold from other users
- Navigate to BNSL (staking) and Trade Finance

No backend is required yet – use local state and mock data.

Tech stack:
- React (Vite + React or Next.js)
- TypeScript (preferred)
- TailwindCSS
- Optional: framer-motion for subtle animations

Brand / Theme:
- Dark, premium, gold-backed fintech
- Background: gradient #000000 → #0D0515 → #1A0A2E
- Accent gold: #D1A954
- Text: #FFFFFF and neutral grays (#E5E7EB, #9CA3AF)
- Cards: glassmorphism (bg-white/5, backdrop-blur, rounded-2xl)
- Font: "Inter" for UI, optional headings "Playfair Display" for premium feel

App Scope:
Implement a full FinaPay screen with:
1. Wallet header + summary strip
2. Wallet home dashboard:
   - Gold balance & valuation (USD/AED)
   - Live gold spot chart (mock data)
   - Recent transactions
   - Quick Actions buttons
3. Modal/panel flows for:
   - Buy Gold
   - Sell Gold
   - Send Gold
   - Request Gold

Integration with FinaVault is only conceptual here:
- We simulate FinaVault ledger updates by updating local state.

────────────────────────
LAYOUT STRUCTURE
────────────────────────

Route/page: `/finapay` or main component `<FinaPayWallet />`.

Top layout:
- Top bar:
  - Title: "FinaPay Wallet"
  - Subtitle: "Digital gold wallet for buying, selling and sending gold."
  - Right side: "Live Gold Spot: 2,350.40 USD/oz" (mock price)

Main layout sections:
1. Balance & valuation cards (top row)
2. Live Gold Spot chart (left) + Recent Transactions (right)
3. Quick Actions row (buttons)
4. Optional: Quick navigation tiles for BNSL and Trade Finance

Use `max-w-5xl mx-auto px-4 py-6` for container.

────────────────────────
SECTION 1: BALANCE & VALUATION
────────────────────────

Top row: 3 cards

1) Gold Balance (grams/kg)
- Title: "Gold Balance"
- Value: e.g., "125.400 g" (or "0.125 kg")
- Subtext: "Gold held in your FinaPay Wallet."

2) Gold Value (USD)
- Title: "Gold Value (USD)"
- Value: e.g., "$7,850.32"
- Subtext: "Calculated using the latest LBMA-linked price."

3) Gold Value (AED)
- Title: "Gold Value (AED)"
- Value: e.g., "AED 28,850.00"
- Subtext: "Local currency view of your gold holdings."

Each card:
- Glass card: rounded-2xl, bg-white/5, backdrop-blur
- Use tailwind for hover: `hover:scale-[1.02] hover:border-[#D1A954] transition-all duration-200`

Underlying state:
- Keep a single `wallet` state object:
  - `goldBalanceGrams`
  - `goldPriceUsdPerGram`
  - `usdAedRate`
  - Computed values for USD/AED.

────────────────────────
SECTION 2: LIVE GOLD SPOT & RECENT TRANSACTIONS
────────────────────────

Two-column layout (stacked on mobile).

LEFT: Live Gold Spot Chart
- Card title: "Live Gold Spot"
- Tabs: "24H | 7D | 30D"
- Implement:
  - A simple line chart with mock data (e.g. using any lightweight chart library or a custom SVG).
  - Show last point value + % change.

RIGHT: Recent Transactions
- Card title: "Recent Transactions"
- Table or list with columns/fields:
  - Date/Time
  - Type (Buy, Sell, Send, Receive, Request)
  - Amount: gold in grams (e.g., "5.000 g")
  - Value: in USD (e.g., "$310.00")
  - Status badge: (Completed / Pending / Failed)

- At bottom: link/button "View all transactions".

Transactions should be stored as an array in state:

`Transaction` includes:
- id: string
- type: "Buy" | "Sell" | "Send" | "Receive" | "Request"
- amountGrams: number
- amountFiatUsd: number
- feeUsd: number
- timestamp: string
- status: "Completed" | "Pending" | "Failed"
- referenceId: string

────────────────────────
SECTION 3: QUICK ACTIONS
────────────────────────

Under the top sections, show a row of **Quick Action buttons**:

Buttons:
- Buy Gold
- Sell Gold
- Send Gold
- Request Gold
- BNSL (link to staking)
- Trade Finance (link to FinaBridge)

UI:
- Use pill/rounded buttons with icon + label.
- On desktop, show them as a row, on mobile use wrapping.

On click:
- For Buy/Sell/Send/Request → open modals (see below).
- For BNSL and Trade Finance → just show placeholder navigation (console.log or alert) “Navigate to BNSL” / “Navigate to Trade Finance”.

────────────────────────
FLOW: BUY GOLD (DEPOSIT CONVERSION)
────────────────────────

Trigger: Click "Buy Gold" button → open modal or side panel.

Modal content:

Step 1: Choose Method
- Radio or select:
  - Crypto
  - Bank Transfer
  - Card (Visa/MasterCard)

Step 2: Enter Amount
- Toggle or tabs:
  - "Enter amount in USD"
  - "Enter target grams"
- Field: USD or Grams
- Show:
  - Calculated other side based on current `goldPriceUsdPerGram`.
  - Example:
    - If user enters $1,000 and price is $60/g → show 16.666 g.

Step 3: Summary
- Show:
  - Payment method
  - Gold to be credited (g)
  - FX or fee info (static text: "Network and processing fees may apply.")
- Button: "Confirm Purchase"

On Confirm:
- Simulate payment success (no real integration):
  - Add the purchased grams to `wallet.goldBalanceGrams`.
  - Add a new transaction of type "Buy" with:
    - status: "Completed"
- Close modal and show a success toast/banner at top:
  - "Successfully bought X.XXX g of gold."

Also conceptually:
- Comment in code: "// Here we would call FinaVault API to credit gold ownership."

────────────────────────
FLOW: SELL GOLD (WITHDRAWAL / CASH OUT)
────────────────────────

Trigger: Click "Sell Gold" → open modal.

Modal sections:

Step 1: Amount
- Input: "Gold amount (grams)" – number
- Show:
  - Equivalent value in USD and AED.

Step 2: Payout Method
- Radio/select:
  - Bank Transfer
  - Crypto Payout
  - Card Refund

Depending on method, show placeholder fields (no need to fully implement IBAN forms here; can just show a text summary).

Step 3: Summary & Confirm
- Show:
  - Gold amount
  - Gross payout
  - Estimated fees (static or simple percentage)
  - Net payout value

On Confirm:
- Deduct gold from `wallet.goldBalanceGrams`.
- Create a "Sell" transaction with status "Completed".
- Show success toast "Sell order executed."

Also add a comment:
- "// Here we would debit FinaVault and trigger payout."

────────────────────────
FLOW: SEND GOLD (INTERNAL TRANSFER)
────────────────────────

Trigger: Click "Send Gold" → open modal.

Fields:
- Recipient ID or Email (text input)
- Amount in grams
- Optional message/description

Validation:
- Non-empty recipient
- Amount > 0
- Amount <= current `goldBalanceGrams`

Add a simple 2FA/OTP step:
- Show "Enter 6-digit OTP" input.
- For now, accept any 6-digit number.

On Confirm:
- Deduct amount from `wallet.goldBalanceGrams`.
- Create a "Send" transaction with status "Completed".
- Optionally create a dummy "Receive" transaction for a mock recipient (purely local).
- Show success toast "Gold sent successfully."

Concept comment:
- "// FinaVault: debit sender, credit receiver."

────────────────────────
FLOW: REQUEST GOLD (PAYMENT REQUEST)
────────────────────────

Trigger: Click "Request Gold" → open modal.

Fields:
- Request From: recipient email/ID
- Amount (grams)
- Description: text

On Submit:
- Save this as a `Pending` "Request" transaction in local state.
- Show a banner: "Request sent to [recipient]."

Also show a "Requests" sub-section somewhere in the page (e.g. under transactions or in separate tab) listing:
- Outgoing requests
- Incoming requests (mocked)

Status:
- Outgoing: "Pending"
- Provide dummy "Approve" / "Decline" buttons for incoming requests:
  - Approve → simulate "Send Gold" from that user to current user.
  - Decline → set status to "Declined".

────────────────────────
TRANSACTION HISTORY
────────────────────────

Below main sections or in a dedicated card, show full transaction history:

Table columns:
- Date/Time
- Type (Buy/Sell/Send/Receive/Request)
- Gold (g)
- Value (USD)
- Fees (USD)
- Status
- Reference ID

Use mock data + any new actions update this history.

Optional: filter by type using pill buttons:
- All | Buy | Sell | Send | Receive | Request

────────────────────────
INTEGRATION WITH FINAVAULT (CONCEPTUAL)
────────────────────────

Add clear comments to show future backend integration:

- In Buy Gold flow:
  - "// TODO: Call FinaVault API to credit gold weight and record ledger entry."

- In Sell Gold flow:
  - "// TODO: Call FinaVault API to debit gold and trigger payout."

- In Send/Receive:
  - "// TODO: FinaVault: debit sender, credit receiver."

- In BNSL / Trade Finance navigation:
  - "// TODO: Navigate to FinaEarn (BNSL) / FinaBridge modules."

No actual API calls needed – just placeholders and code comments.

────────────────────────
STATE & TYPES
────────────────────────

Define TypeScript types:

`Wallet`:
- goldBalanceGrams: number
- goldPriceUsdPerGram: number
- usdAedRate: number

`TransactionType`:
- "Buy" | "Sell" | "Send" | "Receive" | "Request"

`TransactionStatus`:
- "Completed" | "Pending" | "Failed" | "Declined"

`Transaction`:
- id: string
- type: TransactionType
- amountGrams: number
- amountUsd: number
- feeUsd: number
- timestamp: string
- referenceId: string
- status: TransactionStatus
- description?: string

Use React `useState` for wallet and transaction list.

────────────────────────
UX / ANIMATION
────────────────────────

- Use subtle animations:
  - Cards fade-in and slide up on initial load.
  - Buttons have hover scale and gold glow.
  - Modals slide from bottom or right with smooth motion.

- Make everything responsive:
  - On small screens, stack sections vertically.
  - Collapse layout gracefully without losing readability.

────────────────────────
GOAL
────────────────────────

Deliver a **polished, functional FinaPay Wallet UI module** that matches this spec:

- Wallet Overview (gold + fiat values)
- Live Gold Spot chart (mock)
- Quick Action buttons
- Buy / Sell / Send / Request flows (modals)
- Transaction history
- Clean code with TypeScript types and Tailwind styling
- Ready to be hooked to real FinaVault APIs later.
