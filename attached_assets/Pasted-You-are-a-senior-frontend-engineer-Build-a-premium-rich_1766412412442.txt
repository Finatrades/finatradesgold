You are a senior frontend engineer.
Build a premium, rich-UI, animated homepage for FINAGOLD (Powered by Finatrades).

GOAL
Create a high-end black–gold fintech landing page with smooth animations, modern typography, and responsive layout. The homepage must feel “Swiss-grade / enterprise / luxury” and load fast.

TECH STACK
- Next.js (App Router) + TypeScript
- TailwindCSS
- Framer Motion for animations
- lucide-react icons
- Keep components clean and reusable.

BRAND / THEME
- Background: deep black gradient (#000000 → #0A0A0A) with subtle gold dust particles and faint grid lines.
- Accent: metallic gold (#EAC26B) + soft glow.
- Text: white + soft gray.
- Rounded corners: 24px cards, soft shadows, subtle glassmorphism.
- Do NOT use loud colors. Minimal, premium.

PAGE SECTIONS (must implement all)

1) TOP NAVBAR (sticky, blur)
- Left: FINAGOLD logo text + small “Powered by Finatrades” tag
- Center links: Home, Products, How it Works, About, Contact
- Right: toggle pills Personal / Business (only UI toggle), CTA button “Open Account”
- On scroll: navbar becomes slightly more opaque with blur.

2) HERO SECTION (rich, animated)
Left content:
- Small label: “Finagold — Powered by Finatrades”
- H1: “Everyday Money, Made Simple”
- Subtext: “Send money, pay digitally, use your card, and earn with BNSL — all from one secure personal account.”
- Feature bullets (4 items) with icons:
  - Money Transfer (Send & Receive)
  - Digital Payments
  - Card Payments & Withdrawals
  - BNSL Earnings
Buttons:
- Primary: “Open Personal Account →”
- Secondary: “Explore Personal Platform 🌐 →”
Right content (3D-style card mock):
- A floating “Personal Gold” card with gold rim glow, soft reflection, and subtle animated shine sweep.
- Top pill: “Swiss-Regulated Platform” with a small green “ACTIVE” indicator.
Animations:
- Entrance: stagger fade-up for text + buttons + bullets
- Card: gentle floating (y oscillation) + shine sweep every 6–8 seconds
- Background: subtle moving particles (canvas or CSS pseudo elements), extremely light (avoid heavy CPU)

3) PRODUCT TOOLS GRID (4 premium cards)
Title: “Personal Tools”
Subtitle: “Everything you need for daily money movement and earnings.”
Cards (2x2 desktop, 1 column mobile):
- Money Transfer: “Send & receive instantly.”
- Digital Payments: “Pay online and in-store.”
- Card Payments & Withdrawals: “Tap, swipe, withdraw globally.”
- BNSL Earnings: “Grow with structured earnings.”
Each card: icon, title, short line, hover: lift + gold border glow + soft shimmer line.

4) HOW IT WORKS (3 steps)
Step cards with numbered badges:
1. Open account
2. Add funds / balance
3. Use transfers, payments, card, and BNSL
Add a thin gold progress line that animates into view on scroll.

5) TRUST / SECURITY STRIP
Horizontal strip with 4 items:
- Audit-ready logs
- Secure infrastructure
- Transparent balances
- Compliance-first operations
Use small icons and subtle dividers.

6) CTA SECTION (big, cinematic)
Headline: “Ready to use Finagold?”
Subtext: “Open your personal account and start sending, paying, and earning—instantly.”
Buttons: “Open Account” + “Schedule a Call”
Add animated gradient glow behind CTA card.

7) FOOTER
- Logo + “Powered by Finatrades”
- Links columns
- Disclaimer line (short): “Finagold is powered by Finatrades infrastructure. Availability may vary by jurisdiction.”
- Social icons (UI only)

ANIMATION REQUIREMENTS
- Use Framer Motion with viewport triggers (animate when section enters view).
- Use subtle easing, no bounce.
- Keep animations smooth on low-end devices.
- Provide a “prefers-reduced-motion” fallback (reduce animations).

IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS
- Create components:
  /components/Navbar.tsx
  /components/Hero.tsx
  /components/ToolsGrid.tsx
  /components/HowItWorks.tsx
  /components/TrustStrip.tsx
  /components/CTA.tsx
  /components/Footer.tsx
- Create a single page at /app/page.tsx assembling all.
- Add a lightweight particles background:
  - Option A: CSS pseudo-element with small radial gradients + slow keyframes
  - Option B: a tiny canvas particle component capped at ~40 particles, requestAnimationFrame throttled, and disabled for reduced-motion

UI QUALITY BAR
- Spacing: generous padding, clear hierarchy
- Typography: elegant and readable
- Buttons: premium (gold fill primary, outline secondary)
- Cards: glass + gold border + inner glow
- Must be fully responsive.

DELIVERABLE
Return the complete code for all components + page + tailwind setup notes if needed.
Make sure it runs in Replit without extra configuration beyond installing dependencies.
