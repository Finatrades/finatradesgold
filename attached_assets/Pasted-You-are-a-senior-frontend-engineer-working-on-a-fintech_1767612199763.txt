You are a senior frontend engineer working on a fintech web platform (gold-backed system).
Requirement: The entire application must run in LIGHT MODE ONLY. Dark mode is NOT required and must be fully disabled.

GOAL
- App always renders in light theme
- No dark mode toggle
- No system-based (OS) dark mode support
- Consistent light UI across all pages, components, and modals

TASKS

1) REMOVE DARK MODE LOGIC
- Search and remove:
  - theme === "dark"
  - useTheme(), ThemeProvider, DarkModeContext
  - prefers-color-scheme: dark
  - tailwind dark: classes
  - CSS variables or conditions switching colors
- Remove any UI toggle for dark/light mode.

2) FORCE LIGHT THEME GLOBALLY
- Set default theme = "light" at app root
- If using Tailwind:
  - Remove `darkMode: 'class'` or `darkMode: 'media'` from tailwind.config
  - Ensure NO `dark:` utility classes exist
- If using CSS variables:
  - Keep only light color tokens (background, text, border, primary, secondary)

3) OVERRIDE SYSTEM DARK MODE
- Ensure OS/browser dark preference is ignored:
  - Remove matchMedia('(prefers-color-scheme: dark)')
  - Force document/documentElement styles to light colors on load

4) UI CONSISTENCY CHECK
Audit and fix all screens to confirm:
- Backgrounds are light (white / light gray)
- Text is dark (black / charcoal)
- Cards, modals, dropdowns, tooltips follow light palette
- Charts, tables, badges readable in light mode
- No inverted colors on:
  - Wallet
  - BNSL
  - Dashboard
  - Modals
  - Toasts
  - Auth pages

5) COLOR STANDARD (SUGGESTED)
Use a single light palette:
- Background: #FFFFFF / #F8FAFC
- Card: #FFFFFF
- Border: #E5E7EB
- Text Primary: #111827
- Text Secondary: #6B7280
- Primary Accent (Fintech / Gold): existing brand color
Ensure contrast meets accessibility (WCAG AA).

6) CLEANUP & SAFETY
- Remove unused dark-theme CSS variables
- Remove unused icons (moon/sun)
- Ensure future components inherit light styles by default

7) OUTPUT REQUIRED
Provide:
- Files changed
- Confirmation that dark mode is fully disabled
- Screenshot notes (which screens were verified)
- Confirmation that system dark mode does not affect UI

IMPORTANT
This is a LIGHT-MODE-ONLY application. Do not keep any fallback, toggle, or hidden dark mode logic.
Implement cleanly and consistently.

Now apply these changes to the codebase.
