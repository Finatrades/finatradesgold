You are a QA Lead + Product Tester acting as a NORMAL (layman) user AND an Admin.
Your goal is to test this entire platform END-TO-END exactly how a real person would use it,
from registration to daily usage, using realistic mock data.

========================
0) TEST RULES
========================
- Assume ZERO technical knowledge as a normal user.
- Use simple actions a real user would do.
- Do NOT break production data.
- Create mock/demo data only.
- Every issue must include: what user did, what was expected, what happened, why it happened, and how to fix it.
- Create folder: /user_admin_test/ for all outputs.

========================
1) CREATE MOCK DATA (100 USERS)
========================
1.1 Generate:
- 80 Personal users
- 20 Business users

Each user must have:
- Name, email, phone
- Country
- KYC status (pending / approved / rejected)
- Wallet balance (USD + equivalent gold grams)
- Random activity history

Ensure:
- Some users fail KYC
- Some users never complete onboarding
- Some users abandon midway

Output:
- /user_admin_test/01-mock-users.json
- /user_admin_test/01-mock-users-summary.md

========================
2) LAYMAN USER JOURNEY TEST (PERSONAL USER)
========================
For EACH major flow, act like a normal person:

### 2.1 Registration & Login
Test:
- Sign up
- Email verification
- Login/logout
- Forgot password
- Wrong password attempts

Check:
- Clear error messages
- No technical jargon
- Smooth flow

### 2.2 Onboarding & KYC
Test:
- KYC form fill
- Document upload
- Incomplete KYC behavior
- Rejected KYC message clarity

### 2.3 Wallet Usage (FinaPay)
Test:
- Add funds (mock)
- View USD & gold balance
- Send money to another user
- Receive money
- Transaction history understanding

Check:
- Balance accuracy
- Simple wording
- No confusion

### 2.4 Gold Ownership / Vault View
Test:
- View gold holdings
- Certificates visibility
- Locked vs available gold

Check:
- Layman explanation clarity

### 2.5 Withdraw / Transfer
Test:
- Withdraw flow
- Errors if insufficient balance
- Pending vs completed status

========================
3) BUSINESS USER JOURNEY
========================
Test:
- Business registration
- KYB flow
- Role selection (importer/exporter)
- Access to business-only features
- Restrictions for non-business users

Check:
- Feature gating
- Correct messaging

========================
4) ADMIN PANEL TEST (REALISTIC ADMIN USE)
========================
Act as a NORMAL ADMIN (not developer).

### 4.1 Admin Login
Test:
- Login security
- Role-based access

### 4.2 User Management
Test:
- View 100 users
- Search/filter users
- Approve/reject KYC
- Freeze/unfreeze user
- View user wallet & history (read-only)

### 4.3 Transactions & Wallet Control
Test:
- View all transactions
- Detect failed or suspicious transactions
- Manual review flow

### 4.4 Content & System Controls
Test:
- System notices
- Maintenance mode
- Feature enable/disable

========================
5) NEGATIVE & EDGE CASE TESTING
========================
Test:
- User clicks buttons multiple times
- Page refresh during payment
- Network interruption
- Same transfer sent twice
- User tries admin URLs
- User tries another user’s data

========================
6) PERFORMANCE & UX (LAYMAN VIEW)
========================
Check:
- Page load time (<3 seconds)
- Button response
- Mobile vs desktop layout
- Confusing text
- Broken links

========================
7) DATA ACCURACY & CONSISTENCY
========================
Verify:
- User balance = Admin balance view
- Wallet ≠ Vault ≠ Locked balances are consistent
- No negative balances
- Every transaction has history

========================
8) FINAL DEEP REPORT (MANDATORY)
========================
Generate:
- /user_admin_test/FINAL-PLATFORM-TEST-REPORT.md

Report MUST include:
1) Executive summary (non-technical)
2) What works perfectly
3) What confuses layman users
4) Critical bugs
5) High / Medium / Low issues
6) Screens or logs references
7) Clear fix recommendation (simple language)
8) Admin usability issues
9) User trust & clarity score (1–10)
10) Go-Live readiness verdict (YES / CONDITIONAL / NO)

========================
NOW START
========================
Step 1: Generate 100 mock users.
Step 2: Run layman user flows.
Step 3: Run admin flows.
Step 4: Test edge cases.
Step 5: Produce FINAL report.
