You are a senior UI/UX engineer working inside the existing Finatrades codebase.

SCOPE:
UI ONLY.
No backend logic.
No payment logic.
No validation logic changes.
No security implementation changes.
Only visual consistency, layout, spacing, typography, and UI behavior.

GOAL:
Ensure the “Deposit Funds” modal UI matches the EXISTING user dashboard and sidebar theme
and looks visually consistent across all components, modals, and forms.

DO NOT:
- Redesign the flow
- Change colors or branding
- Introduce new UI styles
- Modify business logic or security logic

STEP 1 — IDENTIFY SOURCE UI THEME (Single Source of Truth)
Inspect the current USER DASHBOARD (with sidebar visible) and extract:
- Background colors (app, content, sidebar)
- Card background color
- Border radius values
- Shadow styles
- Font family and font sizes
- Primary button style
- Secondary/outline button style
- Text colors (primary, muted, helper text)

Document these values and treat them as the ONLY allowed UI tokens.

STEP 2 — APPLY SAME THEME TO DEPOSIT FUNDS MODAL
Update the Deposit Funds modal so that:
- Modal background matches dashboard surface color
- Modal border radius matches dashboard cards
- Modal shadow matches dashboard overlays
- Order Summary card uses the same card style as dashboard cards
- Section titles use the same typography as dashboard headings
- Body text uses dashboard body text style

STEP 3 — BUTTON CONSISTENCY
Ensure:
- “Pay $XXX” button uses the same PRIMARY button style as dashboard CTAs
- “Cancel” button uses the same SECONDARY / OUTLINE button style
- Button height, radius, font weight, and hover states match exactly
- No custom colors or inline styles are used

STEP 4 — FORM UI CONSISTENCY
Ensure card input section UI matches dashboard forms:
- Input height, border, radius
- Focus state (border or ring)
- Placeholder color
- Label style and spacing
- Helper/security text style

STEP 5 — MODAL BEHAVIOR (UI ONLY)
Ensure:
- Modal overlay opacity matches other modals
- Modal is centered and responsive
- Spacing between sections is consistent
- Scroll behavior is clean on small screens
- Close (X) icon style matches other modals

STEP 6 — ICONS & TRUST INDICATORS (UI ONLY)
Ensure:
- Lock icon style matches dashboard icon set
- “256-bit SSL Encrypted” text uses muted/helper text style
- Icons are aligned and sized consistently

STEP 7 — CLEANUP INCONSISTENCIES
Search and remove:
- Hardcoded hex colors
- Random Tailwind utility colors not part of dashboard theme
- Inconsistent margins/padding
- Inline styles that break consistency

STEP 8 — FINAL UI CHECKLIST (must pass)
Confirm visually:
- Modal looks like it belongs to the dashboard
- No element looks “out of theme”
- Spacing is balanced
- Typography hierarchy is consistent
- Buttons and cards match the rest of the app

OUTPUT REQUIRED:
- List of UI inconsistencies found (if any)
- File paths/components updated
- Confirmation that Deposit Funds modal UI now fully matches dashboard theme

Start with the Deposit Funds modal component and apply dashboard UI tokens strictly.
