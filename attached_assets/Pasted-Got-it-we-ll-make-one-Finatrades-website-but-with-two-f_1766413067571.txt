Got it — we’ll make **one Finatrades website** but with **two fully different content tracks**:
**Personal** (individual users) and **Business** (corporates / import–export / trade).

I’ll give you:

1. **Site structure (sitemap)**
2. **Per-page content architecture**
3. **Personal vs Business version** for each key block (headlines + short copy you can plug into UI)

You can use the same layout/UI and just switch texts when the toggle changes.
