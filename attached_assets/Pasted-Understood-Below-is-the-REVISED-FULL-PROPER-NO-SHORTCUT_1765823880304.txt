Understood. Below is the **REVISED, FULL, PROPER, NO-SHORTCUT MASTER NARRATION**, with the **important correction clearly applied**:

> ✅ **In BNSL, the user must FIRST transfer value from FinaPay Wallet → BNSL Wallet, and ONLY THEN the gold is locked under the BNSL plan.**

This version is written as a **formal operating narrative**, suitable for:

* Users (education)
* Internal SOPs
* Regulators & auditors
* Developers & product teams

No shortcuts. No assumptions. Full logic.

# FINATRADES

## Complete Gold-Backed Financial Workflow

### (Full Detailed Narration with Examples)

---

## 1. CORE PRINCIPLE (APPLIES TO EVERYTHING)

Finatrades is a **gold-backed financial platform**.

* Users **do not hold cash**
* Users hold **the value of physical gold**
* For understanding and convenience, balances are displayed in:

  * **USD Value**
  * **Gold Backing (grams)**

This principle applies across **all wallets and functions**.

---

## 2. BALANCE DISPLAY RULE (GLOBAL RULE)

In **every wallet**, the user always sees **two values**:

```
USD Value: X,XXX
Gold Backing: XX.XX g
```

This applies to:

* **FinaPay Wallet**
* **FinaVault (ledger view)**
* **BNSL Wallet**
* **FinaBridge Trade Wallet**

USD is only a **value display**.
Gold grams represent the **real asset**.

---

## 3. CERTIFICATE STRUCTURE (MANDATORY DISCLOSURE)

Every gold-backed balance is supported by **two independent certificates**.

### Certificate Responsibility

* **Finatrades**

  * Issues the **Digital Ownership Certificate**
* **Wingold & Metals DMCC**

  * Issues the **Physical Storage Certificate**

Together, they confirm **1:1 physical gold backing**.

---

## 4. DIGITAL OWNERSHIP CERTIFICATE (FINATRADES)

### What it is

A **Digital Ownership Certificate** confirms:

> The user is the **legal digital owner** of a defined quantity of gold recorded in the FinaVault ledger.

It represents **ownership**, not storage.

Think of it as:

> **A digital title deed for gold**

---

### Information contained (conceptual blank page)

* Certificate ID
* User Name
* Wallet ID
* Gold Quantity (grams)
* Purity (e.g., 99.99%)
* Ownership Status:

  * Available
  * Locked (BNSL)
  * Reserved (FinaBridge)
* Issue Date
* FinaVault Ledger Reference
* Issuer: **Finatrades**
* Digital seal / system signature

This certificate updates whenever ownership status changes.

---

## 5. PHYSICAL STORAGE CERTIFICATE (WINGOLD & METALS)

### What it is

A **Physical Storage Certificate** confirms:

> The same quantity of gold is **physically stored** in a secure, insured vault.

It represents **custody**, not ownership transfer.

Think of it as:

> **A warehouse receipt for gold**

---

### Information contained (conceptual blank page)

* Storage Certificate ID
* Vault Operator
* Vault Location
* Gold Quantity Stored
* Purity
* Form (bar / coin / allocated lot)
* Storage Status:

  * Allocated
  * Locked
  * Released
* Storage Start Date
* Reference to Digital Ownership Record
* Issuer: **Wingold & Metals DMCC**
* Authorized vault signature

---

## 6. ADD FUNDS — FINAPAY (FULL FLOW)

### Step 1: User initiates Add Funds

* User selects **Add Funds**
* Chooses payment method (bank transfer / card)
* Enters amount (example: USD 2,000)
* Submits payment

---

### Step 2: Transaction is Pending

* Wallet balance does **not** update
* Transaction history shows:

```
Add Funds | USD 2,000 | Status: Pending
```

Message shown:

> “Your payment is under verification.”

---

### Step 3: Admin verification

Admin checks:

* Payment confirmation
* Bank / gateway reference
* Compliance checks

Admin action:

* Approve or Reject

---

### Step 4: Approval & allocation

Upon approval:

1. USD is converted to gold at approved price
2. **FinaPay Wallet updates**:

   ```
   USD Value: 2,000
   Gold Backing: 31.25 g
   ```
3. **FinaVault records** ownership
4. **Wingold & Metals** allocates physical gold
5. Certificates issued:

   * Digital Ownership – Finatrades
   * Storage Certificate – Wingold & Metals

---

## 7. FINAPAY — SEND / RECEIVE GOLD

### Send example

Charan sends USD 2,000 to Farah
(meaning: the gold equivalent)

Steps:

1. Charan enters amount
2. System calculates grams
3. Ownership transfers instantly

Result:

* Charan balance decreases
* Farah balance increases
* Certificates update for both

---

## 8. FINAVAULT — OWNERSHIP LEDGER

FinaVault is the **core system of record**.

It tracks:

* Gold quantity
* Ownership
* Status:

  * Available
  * Locked
  * Reserved

User view (read-only):

```
USD Value: 8,000
Gold Backing: 125 g
Status: Available
```

---

## 9. BNSL — BUY NOW SELL LATER (CORRECT FLOW)

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:**
Gold cannot be locked directly from FinaPay.
It must first move to the **BNSL Wallet**.

---

### STEP 1: Transfer from FinaPay → BNSL Wallet

* User selects **Transfer to BNSL Wallet**
* Chooses amount (USD or grams)
* Confirms transfer

System actions:

* Gold moves from:

  * **FinaPay Wallet → BNSL Wallet**
* Ownership remains with user
* Status is still **Available**

Display:

```
BNSL Wallet
USD Value: 3,000
Gold Backing: 46.87 g
Status: Available
```

---

### STEP 2: Lock gold inside BNSL

* User selects **Lock in BNSL Plan**
* Confirms plan terms

System actions:

* Gold status changes:

  * Available → Locked (BNSL)
* Custody temporarily held under Finatrades
* Certificates update with **Locked (BNSL)** status

Display:

```
BNSL Wallet
USD Value: 3,000
Gold Backing: 46.87 g
Status: Locked
```

Locked gold:

* Cannot be sent
* Cannot be sold
* Cannot be withdrawn
  until plan completion

## 10. FINABRIDGE — TRADE FINANCE (FULL FLOW)

### Example: Importer settles USD 100,000

1. Importer creates trade case
2. Transfers value from **FinaPay → FinaBridge Wallet**
3. Gold equivalent is locked in FinaVault

   ```
   USD Value: 100,000
   Gold Backing: 1,562 g
   Status: Reserved for Trade
   ```
4. Exporter ships goods
5. Documents uploaded
6. Admin verifies documents
7. Gold ownership released to exporter

Certificates update accordingly.

---

## 11. SELL GOLD / WITHDRAW FUNDS

1. User selects **Sell / Withdraw**
2. Chooses amount
3. Confirms

System actions:

* Gold deducted from ownership
* USD credited for withdrawal
* Certificates update

---

## 12. DEPOSIT PHYSICAL GOLD

1. User submits deposit request
2. Wingold & Metals verifies gold
3. Gold allocated in vault
4. FinaVault credits same gold digitally

Display:

```
USD Value: Live price
Gold Backing: 1,000 g
```

Certificates issued by both entities.

---

## 13. WITHDRAW / DELIVERY OF PHYSICAL GOLD

1. User requests withdrawal
2. Gold deducted from balance
3. Wingold & Metals releases gold
4. Certificates updated

---

## 14. TRANSACTION HISTORY (ALL MODULES)

Each transaction records:

* Date
* Wallet (FinaPay / BNSL / FinaBridge)
* Action
* USD value
* Gold grams
* Status:

  * Pending
  * Approved
  * Completed
  * Locked
  * Reserved
  * Rejected

---

## FINAL USER DISCLOSURE (CLEAR & COMPLIANT)

> **“Your balance is not cash.
> It represents physical gold that you legally own, digitally recorded by Finatrades and physically stored by Wingold & Metals.”**

---

## FINAL ONE-LINE SUMMARY

**“Funds enter FinaPay → become gold-backed → move to BNSL or FinaBridge when needed → gold is locked or settled → ownership and storage are always transparent.”**
