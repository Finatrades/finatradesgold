Executive Summary
1 Executive Summary
Vulnerability Scan Report
Vulnerability scans were conducted on select servers, networks, websites, and applications. This report contains the
discovered potential vulnerabilities from these scans. Vulnerabilities have been classified by severity. Higher severity
indicates a greater risk of a data breach, loss of integrity, or availability of the targets.
1.1 Total Vulnerabilities
Below are the total number of vulnerabilities found by severity. Critical vulnerabilities are the most severe and should
be evaluated first. An accepted vulnerability is one which has been manually reviewed and classified as acceptable
to not fix at this time, such as a false positive detection or an intentional part of the system's architecture.

Vulnerability Scan Report
This section contains the vulnerability findings for each scanned target. Prioritization should be given to the
targets with the highest severity vulnerabilities. However, it is important to take into account the purpose of each
system and consider the potential impact a breach or an outage would have for the particular target.

Description
The integrity attribute is missing on a script or link tag served by an external server. The integrity tag prevents an attacker who have
gained access to this server from injecting a malicious content.
Solution
Provide a valid integrity attribute to the tag.

Vulnerability Scan Report
Description
Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks. Including (but not
limited to) Cross Site Scripting (XSS), and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement
or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of
content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and
embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.
Solution
Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is properly configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

AFFECTED TARGETS
1 target
LAST DETECTED
0 days ago
Vulnerability Scan Report
Description
The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and
Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a
content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type
(if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.
Solution
Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header
to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or
that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

method: GET
param: x-content-type-options
otherinfo: This issue still applies to error type pages (401, 403, 500, etc.) as those pages are often still affected by injection issues, in which case
there is still concern for browsers sniffing pages away from their actual content type. At "High" threshold this scan rule will not alert on client or
server error responses.

Vulnerability Scan Report
Description
HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) is a web security policy mechanism whereby a web server declares that complying user agents
(such as a web browser) are to interact with it using only secure HTTPS connections (i.e. HTTP layered over TLS/SSL). HSTS is an IETF
standards track protocol and is specified in RFC 6797.
Solution
Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to enforce Strict-Transport-Security.

Accepted Vulnerability
An accepted vulnerability is one which has been manually
reviewed and classified as acceptable to not fix at this
time, such as a false positive scan result or an intentional
part of the system's architecture.
Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN)
A fully qualified domain name is a complete domain name
for a specific website or service on the internet. This
includes not only the website or service name, but also the
top-level domain name, such as .com, .org, .net, etc. For
example, 'www.example.com' is an FQDN.
Passive Web Application Vulnerabilities
The OWASP ZAP Passive Web Application scan crawls the
pages of a website or web application. The passive scan
inspects each page as well as the requests and responses
sent between the server. The passive scan checks for
vulnerabilities such as cross-domain misconfigurations,
insecure cookies, vulnerable Javascript dependencies,
and more.
Vulnerability Scan Report
Vulnerability
A weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found
in software and hardware components that, when
exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality,
integrity, or availability. Mitigation of the vulnerabilities in
this context typically involves coding changes, but could
also include specification changes or even specification
deprecations (e.g., removal of affected protocols or
functionality in their entirety).
Target
A target represents target is a single URL, IP address, or
fully qualified domain name (FQDN) that was scanned.
Severity
Severity represents the estimated impact potential of a
particular vulnerability. Severity is divided into 5
categories: Critical, High, Medium, Low and Accepted.
CVSS Score
The CVSS 3.0 score is a global standard for evaluating
vulnerabilities with a 0 to 10 scale. CVSS maps to threat
levels:
0.1 - 3.9 = Low
4.0 - 6.9 = Medium
7.0 - 8.9 = High
9.0 - 10.0 = Critical
EPSS Score
The EPSS score is the estimated probability that a given
vulnerability will be exploited in the wild within the next 30
days, on a 0% to 100% scale.
