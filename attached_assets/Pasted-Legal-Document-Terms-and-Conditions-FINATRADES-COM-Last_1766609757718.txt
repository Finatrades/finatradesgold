NATURE OF SERVICES, ROLES & RESPONSIBILITIES
2.1. Finatrades' Role as Platform Provider
Finatrades operates a technological and administrative platform that provides the following services:

A
Gold Certification & Registry
We provide the digital infrastructure to issue and maintain a registry of Gold Certificates. These Certificates represent beneficial ownership of physical gold that is stored under vaulting agreements managed solely by Commercial Partners.

B
Gold-Based Payment and Settlement System
The Platform enables a payment and settlement system where Gold Certificates function as the medium of exchange. This involves the transfer of ownership of a Gold Certificate (and the beneficial interest in the Underlying Gold) to another User on the Platform. All transactions are settled through the transfer of Gold Certificates, representing gold. Finatrades does not accept, hold, or transmit customer funds. Customer funds for the purchase of gold are converted into gold via a transaction with a Commercial Partner, and all subsequent Platform activity involves the transfer of gold ownership via Gold Certificates.

C
Platform Infrastructure for Commercial Partners
Finatrades provides the neutral digital infrastructure that enables Commercial Partners to offer their services to Users.

D
Operational Support
Finatrades may engage its Affiliates to provide specific technical, operational, or administrative support for the Platform. Such Affiliates act under Finatrades' instruction and for its benefit, and Finatrades remains responsible for their performance under these Terms.

2.2. Critical Clarifications of Status (Disclaimers)
For the avoidance of doubt, and as a fundamental basis of this agreement:

Finatrades is "not a bank". Under Swiss law, the activities of trade finance facilitation, payment settlement in commodities, and commodities-linked financing as conducted by Finatrades through this Platform do not constitute deposit-taking from the public and therefore do not require a banking licence. Finatrades does not hold customer money.

Finatrades is "not a custodian". The physical Underlying Gold is held exclusively by independent, licensed third-party vault operators under Vaulting Agreements entered into by the Commercial Partner (Wingold). Finatrades acts solely as an administrator of the digital registry for the Gold Certificates.

Finatrades is "not a financial advisor" and provides no investment, legal, or tax advice.

Finatrades is "not a principal or counterparty" in commercial gold trading transactions facilitated on the Platform, except where explicitly stated otherwise. Finatrades is a service provider to Commercial Partners, not their agent, partner in a joint venture, or guarantor.

2.3. Commercial Partner Activities – Independent Relationship with Users
The Platform hosts commercial activities conducted by independent third-party Commercial Partners, such as Wingold & Metals DMCC ("Wingold"). Wingold utilizes the Finatrades Platform to offer services, including but not limited to, the execution and management of the "Buy-Now-Sell-Later" (BNSL) plan featured on the Platform.

Independent Contractor Status
Wingold is an independent contractor and principal in all its dealings with Users and with third-party vault operators. Its use of the Platform does not create a partnership, joint venture, agency, or employment relationship between Finatrades and Wingold. Finatrades does not control, manage, or supervise Wingold's business operations, compliance, or its agreements with vault operators.

Direct User-Partner Contract
When you engage in a transaction with a Commercial Partner like Wingold, you are entering into a direct contractual relationship with that Commercial Partner. The terms of that specific transaction, including all commercial terms, warranties, delivery, financial settlement obligations, and crucially, the terms governing the storage and insurance of the physical gold (the Vaulting Agreement), are governed by separate agreements between you and the Commercial Partner and between the Commercial Partner and the vault operator. Finatrades is not a party to any of these agreements.

Vaulting Arrangements
You acknowledge and agree that any vaulting, storage, insurance, or safekeeping services for the Underlying Gold are provided under a Vaulting Agreement between the Commercial Partner (Wingold) and the third-party vault operator. Finatrades is not a party to this agreement, does not guarantee its performance, and has no liability arising from it.

Limitation of Finatrades' Role
Finatrades' role is strictly limited to providing the neutral digital registry, recording, and transaction infrastructure. Finatrades does not: (i) engage in the commercial sale, purchase, or physical handling of gold; (ii) guarantee the performance, solvency, or compliance of Wingold or any vault operator; (iii) hold or transfer funds; or (iv) provide any form of insurance or protection for transactions or storage arrangements.

Partner's Sole Responsibility
Wingold & Metals DMCC remains fully and solely responsible for its own regulatory compliance, licensing, operational conduct, financial obligations, representations made to Users, its agreements with vault operators, and any and all claims arising from its commercial activities or the storage of gold.

3
USER RESPONSIBILITIES & REPRESENTATIONS
You represent, warrant, and covenant that you will:

Provide complete, accurate, and truthful information during onboarding and promptly update it.
Comply fully with all applicable laws, including Swiss AMLA and international sanctions regimes.
Maintain the security of your account credentials and authentication devices. You are solely responsible for all activities under your account.
Not use the Platform for any illegal purpose, including money laundering, terrorist financing, or tax evasion.

Conduct your own due diligence on any Commercial Partner (including Wingold) and any associated vault operator before transacting. You acknowledge that Finatrades does not endorse, vet, or guarantee any Commercial Partner or third-party service provider.

GOLD CERTIFICATES & RISK DISCLOSURE
YOU EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING INHERENT AND SIGNIFICANT RISKS:

No Physical Redemption from Finatrades
A Gold Certificate does not entitle you to take physical possession of the Underlying Gold from Finatrades. It represents a beneficial ownership right exercisable only through the Platform.

Third-Party Vault
The Underlying Gold is held by independent third-party vault operators under agreements with the Commercial Partner. Finatrades is not a party to these agreements and disclaims all liability for the acts, omissions, insolvency, negligence, or fraud of these operators or for any loss, theft, or damage to the Underlying Gold.

Transaction with Commercial Partner
Transactions with Commercial Partner (Wingold) are undertaken at your own risk. You are solely responsible for assessing the creditworthiness, reliability, and compliance of any Commercial Partner. Finatrades is not a party to these contracts and bears no liability for the performance, solvency, non-delivery, misrepresentation, breach, or any other conduct of Commercial Partners. The risk of default by a Commercial Partner rests entirely with you.

Price Volatility
The value of gold can be highly volatile, which will affect the value of your Gold Certificates.

Platform Risk
The Platform is a critical system. Its unavailability, technical failures, or a security breach could prevent access to or transfer of Gold Certificates.

Regulatory Risk
Changes in law or regulation may adversely affect the Platform, Gold Certificates, or the ability of Commercial Partners to operate.

Finatrades explicitly disclaims liability for losses arising from: the insolvency, fraud, or default of a vault operator or Commercial Partner; gold price fluctuations; system failures or cyber-attacks; any act or omission of a Commercial Partner or vault operator; or any force majeure event.

5
PROHIBITED USERS & JURISDICTIONS
Access to and use of the Platform is strictly prohibited for individuals or entities located in, resident of, or incorporated in jurisdictions comprehensively sanctioned by Switzerland, the UN, the EU, or the U.S., or for persons on any sanctions list. Commercial Partners, including Wingold, may impose additional jurisdictional restrictions on their own services.

6
LIABILITY LIMITATION (UNDER SWISS LAW)
TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY THE SWISS CODE OF OBLIGATIONS (OR):

No Liability for Third Parties
Finatrades assumes no liability whatsoever for any acts, omissions, breaches, representations, or damages caused by Service Providers, Commercial Partners (including Wingold & Metals DMCC), vault operators, or other Users. Your recourse for any issues with a third party's services or conduct is solely against that third party.

GOVERNING LAW, JURISDICTION & DISPUTE RESOLUTION
Governing Law for Platform Use
These Terms, and any dispute arising from your use of the Platform in its capacity as a platform provider, shall be governed by the substantive laws of Switzerland, excluding its conflict of law provisions.

Jurisdiction for Platform Disputes
Any such dispute shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the ordinary courts of Geneva, Switzerland. Alternatively, at Finatrades's sole discretion, we may elect to submit any such dispute to final and binding arbitration under the Rules of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) seated in Geneva, conducted in English.

Disputes with Commercial Partners or Vault Operators Are Separate
Any disputes arising from your commercial relationship with a Commercial Partner (e.g., Wingold) or related to vaulting services shall be governed solely by the terms of your separate agreement(s) with those entities and resolved in the forum and manner specified therein. Finatrades is not a necessary or proper party to such disputes. You agree not to name, join, or attempt to involve Finatrades in any legal proceeding against a Commercial Partner or vault operator.

Indemnification for Involvement in Third-Party Disputes
You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Finatrades and its Affiliates from and against any and all claims, damages, liabilities, costs, and expenses (including legal fees) arising from or related to any dispute between you and a Commercial Partner, vault operator, or other third party, including any attempt to involve Finatrades in such a dispute.

8
TERMINATION
Finatrades reserves the right to immediately suspend or terminate your access to the Platform for reasons including compliance with legal obligations, suspected violation of these Terms, or any fraudulent conduct.
