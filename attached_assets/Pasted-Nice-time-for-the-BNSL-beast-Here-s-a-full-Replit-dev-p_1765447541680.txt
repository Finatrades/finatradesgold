Nice, time for the BNSL beast. 🟡
Here’s a full **Replit dev prompt** for the **BNSL module** that matches your FinaVault / FinaPay / FinaBridge style **AND** respects the new legal structure (immediate sale to Wingold, deferred base + quarterly margin in gold).

Just **copy–paste this into Replit AI** 👇

You are a senior frontend engineer.
Build a complete **BNSL – Buy Now Sell Later** module UI for the Finatrades platform.

Concept:
BNSL is NOT a staking product.  
It is a **Deferred Price Sale Agreement** where:

- The user sells physical gold to Wingold & Metals DMCC via the Platform.
- Legal title to the sold gold transfers immediately to Wingold.
- Payment is split into:
  1) **Base Price Component** – fixed monetary value, paid at maturity.
  2) **Margin Component** – fixed monetary value per year (8–12% p.a.), paid via quarterly disbursements.
- Each quarterly disbursement is paid in **physical gold grams**:
  - Monetary margin for the quarter ÷ current market gold price on payout day.
  - The resulting grams are credited to the user’s **Fina wallet** (FinaPay).

This module should:
- Let the user configure and start BNSL plans (12 / 24 / 36 month).
- Show BNSL “wallet” style dashboard with entitlements.
- Show plan details, payout schedule, and risk warnings.
- Simulate early termination penalties.
- Integrate conceptually with FinaPay (gold sold from FinaPay to Wingold).

NO backend for now → use local state + mock data.

Tech:
- React (Vite + React or Next.js)
- TypeScript (preferred)
- TailwindCSS
- Optional: framer-motion for smooth animations

Brand / Theme:
- Same as other Finatrades modules:
  - Dark, premium, gold-backed fintech
  - Background gradient: #000000 → #0D0515 → #1A0A2E
  - Accent gold: #D1A954
  - Text: #FFFFFF + #E5E7EB + #9CA3AF
  - Cards: glassmorphism (bg-white/5, border-white/10, backdrop-blur, rounded-2xl)
  - Font: "Inter" (optionally "Playfair Display" for big headings)

────────────────────────
HIGH-LEVEL UI
────────────────────────

Main route/component: `/bnsl` or `<BnslModule />`

Layout:
- Top bar
- BNSL Summary Strip (global numbers)
- Tabs:
  1. My BNSL Plans
  2. Start New Plan
  3. Early Termination Simulator
  4. Terms & Risk

────────────────────────
TOP BAR
────────────────────────

Top bar content:
- Title: "BNSL – Buy Now Sell Later"
- Subtitle: "Deferred price gold sale with quarterly margin payouts in gold."
- Right side:
  - Badge: "Seller: You" (user is always the original seller)
  - Gold spot: "Gold Spot: 2,350.40 USD/oz" (mock)
  - Info icon for tooltip.

────────────────────────
BNSL SUMMARY STRIP (GLOBAL VIEW)
────────────────────────

Just below top bar, show 3–4 KPI cards:

1) Active Plans
   - e.g. "3 Active Plans"

2) Deferred Base Value (USD)
   - e.g. "$220,000.00"
   - Tooltip: "Total Base Price Component you are entitled to at maturity across all active plans."

3) Annualized Margin Rate (Weighted)
   - e.g. "10.4% p.a."
   - Based on mix of 12/24/36 month plans.

4) Next Quarterly Payout
   - e.g. "Next Payout: 2.35 g on 15 Mar 2026"

All values from BNSL plans state.

────────────────────────
STATE & TYPES
────────────────────────

Define TypeScript types to model plans and payouts.

Plan tenors and margins:
- 12-Month → 8% p.a.
- 24-Month → 10% p.a.
- 36-Month → 12% p.a.

```ts
type BnslTenor = 12 | 24 | 36;

type BnslPlanStatus =
  | "Pending Acceptance"
  | "Active"
  | "Maturing"
  | "Completed"
  | "Early Terminated";

type BnslPayoutStatus = "Scheduled" | "Paid" | "Cancelled";

type BnslPayout = {
  id: string;
  planId: string;
  sequence: number; // 1..4 / 8 / 12
  scheduledDate: string;
  monetaryAmountUsd: number;      // fixed margin per quarter
  marketPriceUsdPerGramAtPayout?: number; // when paid
  gramsCredited?: number;         // computed = monetaryAmountUsd / price
  status: BnslPayoutStatus;
};

type BnslPlan = {
  id: string;
  tenorMonths: BnslTenor;         // 12 / 24 / 36
  marginRateAnnualPercent: number;// 8 / 10 / 12
  goldSoldGrams: number;          // e.g. 100g
  enrollmentPriceUsdPerGram: number; // price at sale
  basePriceComponentUsd: number;  // goldSoldGrams * enrollment price
  totalMarginComponentUsd: number;// base * annual rate * (tenorMonths / 12)
  quarterlyMarginUsd: number;     // totalMargin / numDisbursements
  startDate: string;
  maturityDate: string;
  status: BnslPlanStatus;
  payouts: BnslPayout[];
  // derived/info
  totalPaidMarginUsd: number;
  totalPaidMarginGrams: number;
  earlyTerminationAllowed: boolean;
};
````

Also maintain:

```ts
const [finaPayGoldBalanceGrams, setFinaPayGoldBalanceGrams] = useState<number>(500); // mock
const [bnslPlans, setBnslPlans] = useState<BnslPlan[]>([]);
const [currentGoldPriceUsdPerGram, setCurrentGoldPriceUsdPerGram] = useState<number>(75); // mock
```

Conceptually:

* When user starts a plan, they **sell** from FinaPay: subtract grams from `finaPayGoldBalanceGrams`.

────────────────────────
TAB 1: MY BNSL PLANS
────────────────────────

Table or card list with each plan:

Columns:

* Plan ID (e.g. BNSL-2025-0003)
* Tenure: "12 Months @ 8% p.a."
* Gold Sold: "100.00 g"
* Base Price Component (USD): "$100,000.00"
* Total Margin (USD): "$8,000.00"
* Paid Margin (g): "3.25 g"
* Status: status badge
* Action: "View"

Status badges:

* Active → green
* Maturing → teal
* Completed → gold
* Early Terminated → red
* Pending Acceptance → amber

Click "View" → open **Plan Details** view (new component or route).

Also include small summary card in this tab:

* "Total Gold Sold via BNSL: X.XX g"
* "Total Margin Received: Y.YY g"
* "Total Deferred Base (USD): $Z"

────────────────────────
PLAN DETAILS VIEW
────────────────────────

For selected plan:

Header:

* Plan ID
* "12-Month BNSL Plan @ 8% p.a."
* Status badge
* Start Date – Maturity Date

Sections:

1. Plan Overview Card
2. Payout Schedule (Quarterly table)
3. Timeline: Start → Quarterly payouts → Maturity
4. Early Termination panel (with simulator + warning)

──────── 1) PLAN OVERVIEW CARD ────────

Show:

* Gold Sold: "100.00 g"
* Enrollment Price: "$1,000.00 / g"
* Base Price Component: "$100,000.00" (deferred)
* Total Margin Component: "$8,000.00"
* Tenor: "12 months" → 4 payouts
* Contract Type: "Deferred Price Sale – Title transferred to Wingold at enrollment"

Info text (from T&Cs, paraphrased):

* "You sold this gold to Wingold and no longer own it. You hold a contractual right to receive:

  1. Quarterly Margin Component (in gold grams).
  2. Base Price Component settlement at maturity (in gold grams)."

──────── 2) PAYOUT SCHEDULE ────────

Table:

Columns:

* # (1, 2, 3, 4…)
* Scheduled Date
* Monetary Margin (USD)
* Market Price at Payout (USD/g)
* Gold Credited (g)
* Status (Scheduled/Paid/Cancelled)

For now:

* Market price at payout and grams credited can be mocked or set when you click "Simulate Pay".

Add button "Simulate Next Payout":

* Finds the next Scheduled payout:

  * Uses `currentGoldPriceUsdPerGram`.
  * Sets `marketPriceUsdPerGramAtPayout`.
  * Computes `gramsCredited = monetaryAmountUsd / marketPrice`.
  * Marks status as "Paid".
  * Increments aggregated `totalPaidMarginUsd` and `totalPaidMarginGrams`.
* Also conceptually:

  * "// TODO: Credit these grams to FinaPay wallet in backend."

──────── 3) TIMELINE ────────

Render a horizontal or vertical stepper:

Steps:

1. Enrollment & Gold Sale (Completed)
2. Quarterly Disbursements (In progress / Completed)
3. Maturity & Base Price Settlement (Future / Completed)

Visual:

* Use icons & colors for completed/current/upcoming.

──────── 4) EARLY TERMINATION PANEL ────────

Panel with:

* Warning: "Early termination is a breach of contract and usually results in significant loss."
* Button: "Open Early Termination Simulator"

On clicking:

* Open modal that applies logic from T&Cs (section 5):

Inputs:

* Current Market Price (USD/g) – default = currentGoldPriceUsdPerGram, editable.
* Admin Fee % and Early Withdrawal Penalty %:

  * e.g. Admin Fee: 1% of Total Sale Proceeds
  * Penalty: 5% of Total Sale Proceeds
* Margin Disbursements Already Received (USD) – read from plan’s totalPaidMarginUsd.

Total Sale Proceeds:

* `totalSaleProceeds = basePriceComponentUsd + totalMarginComponentUsd`.

Simulation Steps (as per terms):

Step 1: Base Price Component Valuation

* If current price < enrollment price:

  * baseValue = goldSoldGrams * currentPrice
* Else:

  * baseValue = basePriceComponentUsd (original face value).

Step 2: Deductions:

* adminFee = totalSaleProceeds * adminFeePercent
* earlyPenalty = totalSaleProceeds * penaltyPercent
* reimburseDisbursements = totalPaidMarginUsd
* totalDeductions = adminFee + earlyPenalty + reimburseDisbursements

Step 3: Final Settlement in Gold:

* netValueUsd = baseValue - totalDeductions
* finalGoldGrams = netValueUsd / currentPrice

Show outputs clearly:

* "If you terminate now, you would receive approximately XX.XX g back."
* Compare vs:

  * Original Gold Sold: "100.00 g"
  * Effective Loss: "X.XX g (Y% reduction)"

Button: "Confirm Early Termination" (for simulation only):

* Marks plan status as "Early Terminated".
* Does NOT auto-credit grams to FinaPay in this UI (just a conceptual comment).
* Adds an audit log entry.

────────────────────────
TAB 2: START NEW PLAN
────────────────────────

This is where the user configures and enrolls in a new BNSL plan.

Sections:

1. Selling Gold from FinaPay into BNSL
2. Plan Configuration (Tenor & Rate)
3. Calculated Components (Base & Margin)
4. Terms & Risk Acknowledgement
5. Confirm & Start Plan

──────── 2.1 SELLING GOLD FROM FINAPAY ────────

Show card:

* "Available Gold in FinaPay: 500.00 g" (from `finaPayGoldBalanceGrams`)
* Input: "Gold grams to sell via BNSL" (e.g. 100.00 g)
* Current Market Gold Price at Enrollment (USD/g) – use `currentGoldPriceUsdPerGram`
* Show:

  * "Enrollment Price: $XX.XX / g"

Note: On confirm, we conceptually treat this as an immediate sale to Wingold.

──────── 2.2 PLAN CONFIGURATION ────────

User chooses plan:

* Tenor dropdown or cards:

  * 12 Months – 8% p.a.
  * 24 Months – 10% p.a.
  * 36 Months – 12% p.a.

From selection:

* `annualRate = 0.08 / 0.10 / 0.12`.
* `basePriceComponentUsd = goldSoldGrams * enrollmentPrice`.
* `years = tenorMonths / 12`.
* `totalMarginComponentUsd = basePriceComponentUsd * annualRate * years`.
* `numDisbursements = tenorMonths / 3` → 4 / 8 / 12.
* `quarterlyMarginUsd = totalMarginComponentUsd / numDisbursements`.

Show a calculator card with:

* Base Price Component: "$XXX,XXX.XX (deferred to maturity)"
* Total Margin Component: "$YY,YYY.YY"
* Quarterly Disbursement (USD): "$Z,ZZZ.ZZ"
* Number of Disbursements: 4 / 8 / 12

──────── 2.3 TERMS & RISK ACKNOWLEDGEMENT ────────

Show a scrollable text box with short key points from Terms (no need to paste the full document):

Include:

* "You execute an immediate and irrevocable sale of physical gold to Wingold and Metals DMCC."
* "You no longer own the sold gold; you only hold a contractual right to deferred payments."
* "Base Price Component is paid at maturity in gold grams equivalent."
* "Margin Component is paid quarterly in gold grams based on current market price on payout date."
* "Early termination is a breach and will incur significant fees and reimbursement of margin received."

UI:

* Checkbox:

  * "I confirm I understand that I have sold my gold to Wingold and my rights are contractual only."
* Checkbox:

  * "I understand the severe penalties and potential loss from early termination."
* Button to "View Full Terms & Conditions" that opens a modal showing the full T&Cs (static text).

User must tick both checkboxes to enable final button.

──────── 2.4 CONFIRM & START PLAN ────────

Button: "Start BNSL Plan"

On click:

* Validate:

  * grams > 0 and ≤ FinaPay balance.
  * Tenor selected.
  * Terms checkboxes checked.

If valid:

1. Subtract `goldSoldGrams` from `finaPayGoldBalanceGrams`.
2. Create a new `BnslPlan` object with:

   * status: "Active"
   * computed base and margin values
   * payouts schedule:

     * for each quarter from startDate, create a `BnslPayout` with monetaryAmountUsd = quarterlyMarginUsd.
3. Push into `bnslPlans`.
4. Show success toast:

   * "BNSL plan started. Your gold has been sold to Wingold and quarterly margin payouts will be credited to your Fina wallet."

────────────────────────
TAB 3: EARLY TERMINATION SIMULATOR (GLOBAL)
────────────────────────

Separate from individual plan page, provide a global simulator:

* Dropdown to choose a plan.
* Inputs:

  * Current market price
  * Admin fee % (e.g. 1)
  * Early termination penalty % (e.g. 5)
* Shows the same calculation as the per-plan early termination panel but from a central place.

Purpose:

* Educate user BEFORE they start or terminate.

────────────────────────
TAB 4: TERMS & RISK
────────────────────────

Display a clean, formatted version of the BNSL Terms & Conditions (summary, not full legal text). Key sections:

* Nature of the Plan (Deferred Price Sale Agreement).
* Immediate sale and title transfer to Wingold.
* Base Price & Margin Components.
* Quarterly disbursement mechanism.
* Early termination consequences.
* Risks (market price, liquidity, counterparty, platform, regulatory).

Include at bottom:

* Button: "Back to Start BNSL Plan".

────────────────────────
YIELDS INTEGRATION (STUB)
────────────────────────

Add a small "Yields" box into the My BNSL Plans tab:

* Show:

  * "Total BNSL Margin Earned (g): X.XX g"
  * "Realized Yield (Annualized): Y.Y% (approx.)"
* Note in code:

  * "// This can be surfaced in a global Yields page by aggregating BNSL payouts."

────────────────────────
ANIMATION & UX
────────────────────────

* Use smooth transitions for cards and modals:

  * fade + slide up for main sections.
* Hover states for buttons:

  * `hover:scale-[1.02] hover:border-[#D1A954] transition-all duration-200`
* Responsive:

  * Tables become stacked cards on small screens.
  * Keep all key metrics visible on mobile.

────────────────────────
GOAL
────────────────────────

Deliver a polished **BNSL module** that:

* Treats BNSL as a **sale contract**, not staking.
* Handles gold sale from FinaPay → BNSL at enrollment.
* Computes and displays:

  * Base Price Component (deferred).
  * Margin Component (total + quarterly).
* Manages BNSL plans with status, payout schedule, and summary.
* Provides realistic **early termination simulation** with penalties and reimbursement of margin.
* Clearly communicates **risk and legal structure** in the UI.
* Uses only front-end state and mock data, ready for backend integration later.

```

If you want next, I can write a **small shared `models.ts` prompt** to unify types for FinaVault, FinaPay, FinaBridge, and BNSL in one file so your monorepo is clean.
