You are a senior QA engineer + security reviewer.

Goal:
Verify the "Employee Management" module (Add New Employee modal) is working correctly end-to-end on BOTH:
1) Admin panel behavior
2) User-side access control impact (permissions actually enforce what user can/can’t do)

Module Under Test:
FinaAdmin → Employees → Add Employee modal
Fields:
- Link to User Account (Optional) dropdown
- Role dropdown
- Department text
- Job Title text
- Permissions checklist (view/manage per modules)
- Create Employee button + Cancel button

====================================================
A) ADMIN UI & FORM VALIDATION TESTS (Layman checks)
====================================================
1) Open modal:
- Clicking "Add Employee" opens modal every time (no lag, no duplicate modal).
- Close button (X) and Cancel both close without saving.

2) Required vs optional:
- Confirm which fields are required.
- If required fields missing, show clear human message (not technical error).
- Role must be required. Department/Job title rules must be consistent.

3) Link to User Account dropdown:
- Loads users list correctly (pagination/search if needed).
- Only eligible accounts appear (no blocked/disabled users unless allowed).
- If linked user already assigned as employee, system blocks duplicates with a clear message.

4) Role behavior:
- Changing role should auto-set default permissions (if designed).
- If permissions are custom, ensure role change does not accidentally erase selections without warning.

5) Permissions checklist:
- Scroll works.
- No duplicates, no missing key permissions.
- View vs Manage logic makes sense:
  - If Manage Vault is checked, View Vault should auto-check (or system should enforce).
  - Same for Manage Deposits → View Deposits, Manage BNSL → View BNSL, etc.
- Validate permission naming matches actual modules:
  - FinaPay, FinaVault, FinaBridge, BNSL, KYC Reviews, Transactions, Reports, Settings, Support, CMS.

6) Create Employee action:
- Button disabled until valid.
- On submit, show success toast/message.
- Modal closes and new employee appears in list instantly.
- Form resets if reopened.

====================================================
B) BACKEND / DATA INTEGRITY TESTS (Must be correct)
====================================================
7) Confirm DB/API payload correctness:
- Employee record includes:
  - employeeId
  - linkedUserId (nullable)
  - role
  - department
  - jobTitle
  - permissionSet (array)
  - createdBy adminId
  - createdAt timestamp
- No silent failures.

8) Audit logs (mandatory):
- Creating employee writes an audit log:
  - actor admin
  - action "EMPLOYEE_CREATE"
  - before/after permissionSet
  - timestamp
- Editing or deleting (if exists) also logged.

9) Negative tests:
- Create with invalid linkedUserId → must fail safely.
- Create duplicate employee for same linkedUserId → must fail.
- Permission list empty (if not allowed) → must fail with clear message.

====================================================
C) USER SIDE ENFORCEMENT TESTS (Most important)
====================================================
10) Create 3 test employees and VERIFY REAL access control:
Employee 1: Support role
- View Support ✅
- View Wallet/Vault ❌
Employee 2: Ops role
- Manage Deposits ✅
- View Vault ✅
- Manage Settings ❌
Employee 3: Finance role
- View Reports ✅
- Generate Reports ✅
- Manage Vault ❌

For each employee, login as that user and confirm:
- Sidebar menus show only allowed items.
- Direct URL access to restricted pages is blocked (403/redirect).
- API calls for restricted resources return unauthorized.
- Buttons/actions (approve/reject, create, edit) are hidden/disabled based on permissions.

====================================================
D) SECURITY & MISUSE TESTS
====================================================
11) Ensure no privilege escalation:
- A user cannot change their own role/permissions.
- An admin without "Manage Settings" cannot grant themselves permissions.
- Ensure CSRF protection / auth checks on create employee endpoint.
- Ensure rate limit for admin actions (basic).

====================================================
E) OUTPUT REQUIRED
====================================================
Deliver:
1) PASS/FAIL checklist with screenshots references
2) List of bugs with steps to reproduce
3) Missing validations or permission gaps
4) Recommended fixes (short, actionable)
5) Confirmation that UI permissions match backend enforcement (or highlight mismatch)

Do NOT write new features unless required.
Focus on verifying correctness, security, and real-world admin usability.
