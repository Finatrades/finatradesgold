Create a fully animated “How It Works” section in a structured snake-style path for the Finatrades Business Platform.

Overall Concept:
A metallic gold snake timeline representing a corporate workflow. Use a more structured, institutional style—sharper corners, precise geometry, and enterprise-level animations. The snake should look like a controlled digital flow that moves between corporate checkpoints.

Style Requirements:
• Deep black background with metallic gold accents
• Precision-line snake path with smooth turns
• Subtle digital particles moving along the path
• Corporate-style node indicators with LED-like lights
• Transparent rectangular text cards with gold edge strokes
• Serious, institutional, compliant feel (BlackRock × Goldman Sachs × Swiss Banking)

Animation Behavior:
The snake line illuminates each corporate step, giving a sense of governance, compliance, and operational control.

Steps for BUSINESS:

Step 01 — Register a Corporate Profile
Icon: Building or corporate outline
Text: “Submit company details, authorized signatories, and compliance documents.”

Step 02 — KYB & Compliance Review
Icon: Document + shield
Text: “Finatrades performs a Swiss-aligned corporate verification process.”

Step 03 — Establish Gold Reserve Account
Icon: Multi-user or dashboard with roles
Text: “Set user roles, permissions, and operational limits for your organization.”

Step 04 — Deposit Physical Gold
Icon: Gold bars + warehouse
Text: “Deposit existing bars through verified channels into approved vaults.”

Step 05 — Receive Vault Certificates
Icon: Certificate or stamp
Text: “Each deposit generates standardized vault documentation.”

Step 06 — Use Gold Value for Trade & Treasury
Icon: Arrows or global trade icon
Text: “Integrate gold value into trade flows, settlements, or collateral structures.”

Step 07 — Reporting & Audit Controls
Icon: File or graph
Text: “Access detailed reports for accounting, governance, and external audits.”

Motion Sequence:
• Corporate snake animates in a controlled rhythm.
• At each node: glow pulse → icon highlight → text card slides up.
• End with CTA: “Explore Business Platform”.

Make it serious, powerful, regulated, and enterprise-grade.
